Here are some data analysis questions you can explore with your space missions dataset:

1. **What is the distribution of missions by company?**
   - Analyze the frequency of missions for each company to understand which organizations are the most active in space missions.

2. **Where are most space missions launched from?**
   - Determine the most common launch locations and see if there are any geographical patterns in space missions.

3. **How has the number of space missions evolved over the years?**
   - You can group missions by year and visualize the trend in the number of space missions over time.

4. **What is the success rate of space missions by company?**
   - Calculate the success rate for each company by dividing the number of successful missions by the total number of missions they've conducted.

5. **Are there any patterns in the status of rockets used for missions?**
   - Explore the different rocket statuses and see if there are any trends or patterns in the data.

6. **What is the distribution of the payload weight (Rocket column) for space missions?**
   - Calculate summary statistics and create a histogram or box plot to understand the distribution of payload weights.

7. **Are there any notable details about failed missions (Status Mission not "Success")?**
   - Analyze the "Detail" column for failed missions to identify any common issues or causes of mission failures.

8. **Which company has the highest average payload weight per mission?**
   - Calculate the average payload weight for each company and compare them.

9. **Is there a correlation between the location of the launch site and mission success?**
   - Group missions by launch location and calculate the success rate for each location to see if there is any correlation.

10. **What are the most common rocket types (Rocket column) used for space missions?**
    - Analyze the frequency of different rocket types to identify the most commonly used ones.

11. **How has the success rate of space missions changed over time?**
    - Calculate the success rate for each year to see if there are trends in mission success over time.

12. **What is the average cost (Rocket column) for successful missions by company?**
    - Calculate the average cost for successful missions conducted by each company.

These questions should help you get started with your data analysis of the space missions dataset. Depending on your specific goals, you can dive deeper into any of these areas and perform more advanced analyses as needed.
